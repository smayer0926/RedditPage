## Purpose
_This was a one day project that was created at Epicodus during the JavaScript unit. The purpose was to dive into Angular and be able to create an application from it._

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to see several discussion categories (sub-reddits, boards, etc.) on the main page.
* As a user, I want to click a category to visit its collection of posts.
* As a user, I want to click a post to view its contents (For now simply hide/show contents. Routing to a page for a specific post requires concepts from tonight's homework).
* As a user, I want to click on a post to expand/collapse it, so I can view whatever funny picture, link, or news article other users have posted.
* As a user, I want to add new posts to a discussion category.
* As a user, I want to update my post as necessary.
* As a user, I want the option to delete my post.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Future Exploration
* _To be able to sort through different categories using a pipe._
* _More functionality, or an API call to populate the database._
